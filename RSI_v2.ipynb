RSI is an acronym of Relative Strength Index. It is a momentum indicator, that uses the magnitude of price changes, to evaluate if a security is overbought or oversold.\nIf the RSI value is over 70, the security is considered overbought, if the value is lower than 30, it is considered to be oversold. Overbought refers that the bubble created from the buying might pop soon, and therefore the price will drop. This creates a strong entry point.\nHowever, good practice is to make a selling order, only when the RSI value intersects the overbought line, as this is a more conservative approach. At least to guessing when the RSI will reach the highest point.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0e7f4d-ead5-4300-9d28-ef00227faa37"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Concept:\nThis program seeks to use the talib (technical analysis) library to implement the intersection between the RSI line and the oversold and overbought line.
